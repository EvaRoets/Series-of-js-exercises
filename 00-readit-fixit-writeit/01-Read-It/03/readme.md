* Open script.js and try to predict the result of the script. Explain.
* Open the developer tools in your browser and inspect the 'console' tab.

➡️The script.js indicates: 
	- execute statement 1: sets variable i = 0 before the loop starts
	- defines the condition for the loop to run: i must be smaller than the constant 10 (true)
	- execute statement 3: increase the value i++ each time the code statement 1 is executed. 
➡️The script.js will display paragraphs, each containing variable i = 0 +1, up and to 10.
