## Learning objectives
- Working with DOM elements in javascript.
- Knowing how to create, populate and append DOM elements.
- Knowing how to style it properly.
- Learning how to look for solutions to problems.

## The Mission
In order to correctly work with dynamic content in future projects, it's important to understand and learn how to create elements, add properties and display them with JavaScript.     
Create a responsive page by only using javascript, a html file with an empty body (except for the import script) and a css file (or an alternative way of styling your content).

## Must-have features
- It must have a responsive interface for laptops and mobile screens (e.g. responsive holy grail lay-out)
- All elements inside the `<body>` are to be created in your `script.js`
- Your page has to be completely styled with css (frameworks may also be used for this)

## Nice-to-have features
- Have a button creating a new section (also with javascript)
- Interactive content (e.g. alert box with submitted text, simple calculator, ...)
- Any cool extra's you can find and add within the given time of the challenge
