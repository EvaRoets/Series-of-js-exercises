# READ IT
## EX 04
* Open script.js and read the code. What do you think will happen. Try to explain in your own words.

➡️The script.js indicates: 
	- write a order list of:
	- execute statement 1: sets variable i = 0 before the loop starts
	- defines the condition for the loop to run: i must be smaller than the number of letters the strings of the constant constains (true)
	- execute statement 3: increase the value i++ each time the code statement 1 is executed.
